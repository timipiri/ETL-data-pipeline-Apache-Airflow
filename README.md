# ETL-data-pipeline-Apache-Airflow
In this project, I demonstrate how to create and automate an ETL data pipeline using Apache Airflow.
Among other things,  the DAG will extract data from the following file formats: CSV, TSV, Fixed Width File, then we will merge these files into one single CSV file.
We also transform the data by renaming some columns.
This project was done using Python and Apache Airflow.
